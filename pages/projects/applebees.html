              <h2>The Project</h2>

              <p>
                This was a completely made up website project in order to help me hone my design and development skills. I took the current Applebee’s website, and while keeping the color scheme similar, recreated the style and feel of the website. Along with the website itself, I also took it upon myself to recreate the Applebee’s logo. The current Applebee’s website, to me, was a little too overcrowded with information, and a little difficult to navigate. With my design, the same information is displayed, but is a little more pleasing to the eye.

            <div id="img-proj_ab2" class="top">
              <img src="../../images/ab2.png" alt="Applebees image2">

            <div class="text-proj">
              <h2>The Process</h2>

              <p>
                As with most of my projects, I began sketching and eventually moved on to Photoshop to experiment with different layouts. Because I was only redesigning an already existing website, it was much easier for me to plan and simply rearrange and remove items since no new information had to be created.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p>
                Keeping user experience in mind, the entire menu was also completely remodeled, reorganized, and designed to be consistent. With the use of some JQuery, I was also able to manipulate the menu animations to my satisfaction and created a much easier way to navigate the menu. The most difficult part of this project, surprisingly, was the footer. The animations I had in mind were somewhat difficult to master when pairing them with my media queries needed for responsiveness, but, with some trial, error, and a little bit of research, I was able to overcome the issue to complete my footer design and bring this project to a close.

            <div class="text-proj">
              <h2>The End Result</h2>

              <p>
                The end result was a beautiful redesign that I am happy to call my own. Not only was I able to practice and experiment with my design and development skills, but I was able to put my organizational skills to the test, eventually having everything flow together better than I could have imagined.
