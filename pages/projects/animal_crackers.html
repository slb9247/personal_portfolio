              <h2>The Project</h2>

              <p>
                This was my first live website project done for a local pet shop, Animal Crackers. The current “website” at the time this project was started was extremely inaccurate and inaccessible, leaving the owner of the shop lacking on the internet. Initially, the main concern of the project was to emphasize the correct hours and contact information of the shop and focus on the grooming page. Eventually, the project grew to be much more than that, now “introducing” all of the site’s visitors to the animals of Animal Crackers and being the home of news and information for the newest addition to the shop, Paint Nights!

            <div class="text-proj">
              <h2>The Process</h2>

              <p>
                Because the owner of the shop was mostly concerned with the shop information being listed on the website, I had a lot of creative freedom on this project. The color scheme, layout, and even some of the picture choices were all a part of my original design, along with a few suggestions from the shop owner. Although there are many images featured on the site, I did my best to keep everything clean and easily accessible. Also, due to the original concern about the shop hours and contact information, I resorted to displaying all of that information as a footer on every page in order for it to easily be seen.

              <p>
                With the entire site being hand-coded by yours truly, I put my CSS3 and JQuery skills to the test, constantly learning new and better ways to code. One of my biggest challenges was changing the modal information depending on which image on the home page had been clicked. Luckily, I was able to overcome this challenge with the help of some fellow developers and a few JQuery if...else statements. I also took advantage of the use of a couple plugins and a Google maps API just to change things up a bit and become a little more well-rounded in other methods of development.

              <h2>The End Result</h2>

              <p>
                Using skill, creativity, and a bit of research, I was able to successfully complete the website that both I, and the owner of Animal Crackers, were satisfied with. With this being my very first live website, I was very pleased with the end result and continue to update the site on a regular basis.
